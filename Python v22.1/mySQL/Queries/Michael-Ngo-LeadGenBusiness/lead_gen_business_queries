1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM billing.charged_datetime) AS month, SUM(billing.amount) AS revenue FROM lead_gen_business.billing
	WHERE billing.charged_datetime >= '2012-03-01' AND billing.charged_datetime <= '2012-03-31'

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name,' ', clients.last_name) AS name , SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue FROM lead_gen_business.clients
	JOIN lead_gen_business.billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
    WHERE clients.client_id = 2;


3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?

SELECT sites.site_id, sites.domain_name, sites.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name,' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name FROM lead_gen_business.sites
	JOIN lead_gen_business.clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    	WHERE sites.client_id = 10;


4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?

-- client id 1
SELECT clients.client_id,CONCAT(clients.first_name,' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(sites.site_id) AS sites_created, MONTH(sites.created_datetime) AS month, YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS year FROM lead_gen_business.sites
	JOIN lead_gen_business.clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    	WHERE clients.client_id = 1
    	GROUP BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) , YEAR(sites.created_datetime)
	ORDER BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) ASC;

-- client id 20
SELECT clients.client_id,CONCAT(clients.first_name,' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(sites.site_id) AS sites_created, MONTH(sites.created_datetime) AS month, YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS year FROM lead_gen_business.sites
		JOIN lead_gen_business.clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    	WHERE clients.client_id = 20
    	GROUP BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) , YEAR(sites.created_datetime)
	ORDER BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) ASC;



5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_of_leads, sites.domain_name, leads.registered_datetime FROM lead_gen_business.sites
	JOIN lead_gen_business.leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    	WHERE leads.registered_datetime >='2011-01-01' AND leads.registered_datetime <='2011-12-31'
    	GROUP BY sites.domain_name;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_of_leads FROM lead_gen_business.clients
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    	WHERE leads.registered_datetime >='2011-01-01' AND leads.registered_datetime <='2011-12-31'
	GROUP BY clients.client_id
    ORDER BY num_of_leads DESC;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_of_leads, MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) as month FROM lead_gen_business.clients
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    	WHERE leads.registered_datetime >='2011-01-01' AND leads.registered_datetime <='2011-06-30'
	GROUP BY clients.client_id
    	ORDER BY num_of_leads DESC;


8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
--A
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name AS website, COUNT(leads.site_id) AS 'lead' FROM lead_gen_business.clients
	JOIN lead_gen_business.sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    	WHERE leads.registered_datetime >='2011-01-01' AND leads.registered_datetime <='2011-12-31'
   	GROUP BY sites.domain_name
    	ORDER BY clients.client_id;

--B
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name AS website, COUNT(leads.site_id) AS 'lead' FROM lead_gen_business.clients
	JOIN lead_gen_business.sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    	JOIN lead_gen_business.leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    	GROUP BY sites.domain_name
    	ORDER BY clients.client_id;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.  First try this with integer month, second with month name.  A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS total_amount, MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) AS month, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year FROM lead_gen_business.clients
	JOIN lead_gen_business.billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
    	GROUP BY MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) 
    	ORDER BY clients.client_id ASC;



10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a single field. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ') as sites FROM lead_gen_business.clients
	JOIN lead_gen_business.sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    	GROUP BY clients.client_id;
